# Chatter — Project Guide

## What this is

A vertical-agnostic AI chat platform — embeddable widget + admin dashboard —
in the spirit of Zipchat AI, but not restricted to ecommerce. The same core
engine should serve ecommerce, healthcare, automotive, and any other
industry, powered by Claude.

## Status: active build

Tech stack is chosen (ADR 0002) and real code exists — see README.md for
what's scaffolded. A few architecture questions are still open; check
`docs/open-questions.md` before scaffolding a component whose design is
listed there. If you're asked to build something whose design is still
open, resolve the question with the user (or write the ADR if it's
implicitly obvious) before writing code, don't guess silently.

## Where things live

- `docs/product-spec.md` — MVP scope and product decisions made so far
- `docs/architecture.md` — system design, living doc, updated as decisions land
- `docs/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records, one per significant,
  hard-to-reverse decision. Template at `docs/adr/template.md`.
- `docs/research/` — competitive and technical research notes
- `docs/open-questions.md` — decisions not yet made; owner is the user

## Non-negotiable guardrails

These hold regardless of what stack or framework we end up on.

1. **Tenant isolation is sacred.** One business's knowledge base,
   conversations, config, or analytics must never leak into another
   business's bot context, retrieval results, logs, or dashboard — no
   exceptions, no shortcuts for convenience or speed.
2. **No vertical-specific logic in the core engine.** Anything specific to
   ecommerce/healthcare/automotive/etc. goes through the template/config
   layer (see `docs/adr/0001-generic-base-with-vertical-templates.md`). If
   you find yourself writing `if industry == "healthcare"` in core code,
   stop — that belongs in a template, not the engine.
3. **Regulated verticals get explicit guardrail prompts, not vibes.**
   Healthcare/finance/legal templates must refuse diagnosis/legal/financial
   advice and say so plainly in their default system prompt. This is part
   of the template definition, not an afterthought bolted on later.
4. **Every action tool degrades gracefully.** If a business hasn't wired up
   a real integration (order lookup, booking system, inventory API, etc.),
   the tool falls back to "collect info, hand off to a human" — it never
   fails silently and never hallucinates an answer it can't back up.
5. **Secrets never ship to widget client code.** The embeddable widget only
   ever talks to our backend over its own API; it never holds a Claude API
   key, DB credential, or any other secret.
6. **Every AI answer is traceable.** Log what was retrieved and which tools
   were called for a given response, so debugging and trust don't rely on
   guesswork.

## Process rules

- Record every hard-to-reverse decision (data model shape, storage choice,
  auth model, multi-tenancy strategy, vendor choice) as an ADR using the
  `new-adr` skill and `docs/adr/template.md`.
- Capture non-trivial research (competitor analysis, library evaluation,
  architecture pattern comparison) in `docs/research/` using the
  `research-note` skill — it needs to survive context compaction and be
  usable by a future session, not just live in chat scrollback.
- Don't scaffold code for a component whose design is still listed in
  `docs/open-questions.md`. Resolve it or explicitly flag the assumption
  you're making first.
- The standard engineering rules already in the system prompt still apply
  in full (no speculative abstraction, no unnecessary error handling,
  minimal comments, etc.) — this file adds project-specific rules on top,
  it does not replace those.
- **Never commit code that hasn't actually been run.** `npx tsc --noEmit`
  catches TypeScript boundary mismatches; it does not catch a broken SQL
  migration, a stale dependency version, or whether RLS policies even got
  created — none of those are visible from reading code. This isn't
  theoretical: a real test run (README.md's "Verified by a real run")
  found three such bugs in already-committed code, including every RLS
  policy silently failing to create. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs
  `scripts/verify-rls.mjs` and a full build against a real Postgres+
  pgvector instance on every push — but CI catching it after the fact is
  the backstop, not the plan. When touching a migration, the gateway, or
  anything RLS-adjacent, actually run it (or `scripts/verify-rls.mjs`)
  before committing, in the same pass, not as a separate later step.
- **Check real version numbers, don't recall them.** A dependency version
  pinned from training-data memory can be a full major version stale (this
  happened with `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, silently missing a GA feature already
  in use). Run `npm view <package> version` before pinning anything new.
