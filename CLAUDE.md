# Chatter — Project Guide

## What this is

A vertical-agnostic AI chat platform — embeddable widget + admin dashboard —
in the spirit of Zipchat AI, but not restricted to ecommerce. The same core
engine should serve ecommerce, healthcare, automotive, and any other
industry, powered by Claude.

## Status: pre-build / planning phase

Tech stack and several architecture questions are still open. **Do not
scaffold application code (frontend, backend, DB schema, etc.) until the
relevant open question is resolved** — check docs/open-questions.md first.
If you're asked to build something whose design is still open, resolve the
question with the user (or write the ADR if it's implicitly obvious) before
writing code, don't guess silently.

## Where things live

- `docs/product-spec.md` — MVP scope and product decisions made so far
- `docs/architecture.md` — system design, living doc, updated as decisions land
- `docs/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records, one per significant,
  hard-to-reverse decision. Template at `docs/adr/template.md`.
- `docs/research/` — competitive and technical research notes
- `docs/open-questions.md` — decisions not yet made; owner is the user

## Non-negotiable guardrails

These hold regardless of what stack or framework we end up on.

1. **Tenant isolation is sacred.** One business's knowledge base,
   conversations, config, or analytics must never leak into another
   business's bot context, retrieval results, logs, or dashboard — no
   exceptions, no shortcuts for convenience or speed.
2. **No vertical-specific logic in the core engine.** Anything specific to
   ecommerce/healthcare/automotive/etc. goes through the template/config
   layer (see `docs/adr/0001-generic-base-with-vertical-templates.md`). If
   you find yourself writing `if industry == "healthcare"` in core code,
   stop — that belongs in a template, not the engine.
3. **Regulated verticals get explicit guardrail prompts, not vibes.**
   Healthcare/finance/legal templates must refuse diagnosis/legal/financial
   advice and say so plainly in their default system prompt. This is part
   of the template definition, not an afterthought bolted on later.
4. **Every action tool degrades gracefully.** If a business hasn't wired up
   a real integration (order lookup, booking system, inventory API, etc.),
   the tool falls back to "collect info, hand off to a human" — it never
   fails silently and never hallucinates an answer it can't back up.
5. **Secrets never ship to widget client code.** The embeddable widget only
   ever talks to our backend over its own API; it never holds a Claude API
   key, DB credential, or any other secret.
6. **Every AI answer is traceable.** Log what was retrieved and which tools
   were called for a given response, so debugging and trust don't rely on
   guesswork.

## Process rules

- Record every hard-to-reverse decision (data model shape, storage choice,
  auth model, multi-tenancy strategy, vendor choice) as an ADR using the
  `new-adr` skill and `docs/adr/template.md`.
- Capture non-trivial research (competitor analysis, library evaluation,
  architecture pattern comparison) in `docs/research/` using the
  `research-note` skill — it needs to survive context compaction and be
  usable by a future session, not just live in chat scrollback.
- Don't scaffold code for a component whose design is still listed in
  `docs/open-questions.md`. Resolve it or explicitly flag the assumption
  you're making first.
- The standard engineering rules already in the system prompt still apply
  in full (no speculative abstraction, no unnecessary error handling,
  minimal comments, etc.) — this file adds project-specific rules on top,
  it does not replace those.

## Once the stack is chosen

This file, `.claude/settings.json`, and `.claude/skills/` should be extended
with stack-specific tooling: lint/typecheck/test commands wired into a
SessionStart hook (see the `session-start-hook` skill), a database MCP for
schema inspection once a DB is chosen, and skills for recurring scaffolding
tasks (new vertical template, new action tool). Not done yet — see
`docs/open-questions.md` for what's blocking it.
